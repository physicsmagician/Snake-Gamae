# Snake-Game
This program is a remake of the classic snake game that I used to play on my dad's old Nokia phone. 
To play the game go to the src->AnimationLoopShell->ExampleFrame->Run

RULES:
The rules of the game are simple: Grow as long as you can without bumping into any barriers!
There are 5 levels total with one BONUS level (see if you can figure out who this special snake is)!
Be careful, as the levels will speed up as you go on. 
Enjoy! (not a rule but technically you shuold have fun)

TECHNOLOGY USED:
This project was developed in Java on the Eclipse IDE. This project was originally created for my
computer science class, but I didn't use much of the templates provided. I decided to go my own approach
on the game and created the snake game rather than a classic jumper or shooter. It was tough but I had
some valuable help from my wonderful teacher and the internet. 

INFO ABOUT DEVELOPMENT:
I had documented all the stages of development of this project on Microsoft Word Document via Google Drive, 
since that was most convenient to me. The file is lost now, but the gist was that I logged everything that
I wanted to do, any problems I faced, and breakthroughs in progress. I remember that I estimated that this
entire project would take about 20 hours and I ended up being right because it took me 21 hours over the
span of a month. 
I was really proud of when my game finally worked. That feeling you get when your code just runs is so
exhilarating and it inspires me to keep making more. 

SPOILERS:
The BONUS level is based off of the Egyptian God Apep symbolized as a snake who eats the sun, Ra. 

HOW TO CONTRIBUTE:
Let me know what you think of the game! I am always open to constructive-criticism!
